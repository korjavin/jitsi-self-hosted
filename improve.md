# Project Improvements and Security Analysis

This document outlines identified discrepancies, security considerations, and recommendations for improving the self-hosted Jitsi Meet deployment project.

## 1. Discrepancies and Configuration Issues

Several inconsistencies and potential misconfigurations were found between the documentation (`readme.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) and the configuration files (`.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml`).

### 1.1. Critical: Incorrect XMPP Domain Configuration

- **Issue:** The `.env.example` file hardcodes `XMPP_DOMAIN` and related variables to `meet.jitsi`, `auth.meet.jitsi`, etc. This is incorrect and will cause the XMPP server (Prosody) to fail for any user-provided domain.
- **Recommendation:** These variables should be dynamically configured based on the `JITSI_DOMAIN` variable. For example, `XMPP_DOMAIN` should be set to `${JITSI_DOMAIN}`.

### 1.2. Confusing and Redundant Variables in `.env.example`

- **Issue:** The `.env.example` file contains several variables that are either unused, redundant, or confusing.
  - `HTTP_PORT` and `HTTPS_PORT`: These are set to `8000` and `8443` but are not used in the `docker-compose.yml` file for publishing ports. Traefik handles traffic, so these variables are misleading.
  - `STUN_SERVERS` and `JVB_STUN_SERVERS`: Both variables exist and are set to the same value. This is redundant.
- **Recommendation:** Remove `HTTP_PORT`, `HTTPS_PORT`, and `STUN_SERVERS` from `.env.example` to simplify the configuration.

### 1.3. Potentially Incorrect Default IP Address

- **Issue:** `DOCKER_HOST_ADDRESS` in `.env.example` defaults to a private IP address (`192.168.1.100`). This will never be the correct value for a public-facing server and is a common source of error for users.
- **Recommendation:** Change the default value to a clear placeholder like `YOUR_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP` to force the user to configure it correctly.

### 1.4. Disorganized `.env.example` Structure

- **Issue:** The `JITSI_DOMAIN` variable is located at the bottom of the file, while `PUBLIC_URL`, which depends on it, is at the top. This is illogical and can lead to user confusion.
- **Recommendation:** Group all domain-related variables at the top of the `.env.example` file.

### 1.5. Missing License File

- **Issue:** The `readme.md` refers to a `LICENSE` file, but this file does not exist in the repository.
- **Recommendation:** Add a `LICENSE` file (e.g., using the MIT License) to clarify the terms of use.

### 1.6. Outdated `CLAUDE.md`

- **Issue:** The `CLAUDE.md` file mentions a Portainer service that is not defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
- **Recommendation:** Remove the mention of the Portainer service from `CLAUDE.md` to avoid confusion.

## 2. Security Considerations and Recommendations

The following are security-related observations and suggestions for hardening the Jitsi deployment.

### 2.1. Silent Deployment Failures in GitHub Actions

- **Issue:** The `deploy.yml` workflow uses `continue-on-error: true` for the Portainer webhook step. This means that if the webhook fails to trigger, the workflow will still report success, potentially leading to silent deployment failures.
- **Recommendation:** Remove `continue-on-error: true` to ensure that deployment failures are properly reported.

### 2.2. Default Lack of Authentication

- **Issue:** The default configuration has authentication disabled (`ENABLE_AUTH=0`), making the Jitsi instance publicly accessible. While this may be intended, it should be an explicit choice by the user.
- **Recommendation:** Add a prominent note in the `readme.md` and `improve.md` about the security implications of running a public Jitsi instance and strongly recommend enabling authentication for private or corporate use.

### 2.3. Outdated Docker Image Version

- **Issue:** The Jitsi Docker image version is pinned to `stable-9364`. While pinning versions is good for stability, this tag may become outdated and miss important security patches.
- **Recommendation:** Advise users to periodically check for new stable releases of the Jitsi Docker images and update the `JITSI_IMAGE_VERSION` variable in their `.env` file.

### 2.4. Plaintext Secrets in `.env` File

- **Issue:** All secrets are stored in plaintext in the `.env` file. While this is a common practice for Docker Compose, it is a security risk if the file is not properly handled.
- **Recommendation:** Emphasize in the documentation that the `.env` file contains sensitive information and must never be committed to version control. The existing `.gitignore` entry is good, but user awareness is key.

## 3. General Suggestions for Improvement

- **Clarify Traefik Network Configuration:** The `readme.md` could be clearer that the `jitsi-network` must be connected to the Traefik container for the reverse proxy to work.
- **Add a Troubleshooting Section for Traefik:** Common issues with Traefik, such as network connectivity or label misconfigurations, would be a useful addition to the troubleshooting guide.
- **Provide Guidance on Updating:** Add a section to the `readme.md` on how to properly update the Jitsi stack, including pulling new images and re-creating containers.
